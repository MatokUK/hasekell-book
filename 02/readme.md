Parenthesise the following numeric expressions:

```
2^3*4

```

#### Solution
```
(2^3)*4 
(2*3)+(4*5)

### 3

The script below contains three syntactic errors. Correct these errors and then check
that your script works properly.


```
N = a 'div' length xs
    where 
        a = 10
       xs = [1,2,3,4,5]
```

#### Solution

### 4
The library function `last` selects the last element of non-empty list. Show how
the function `last` could be defined in terms of the other library functions introduced in this chapter.

#### Solution
defined `last'`

---

### 5
The library function `init` removes the last element from non-empty list; 
(`init [1,2,3,4,5] = [1,2,3,4]`)  Show how `init` could similarly be in two different ways.
  
#### Solution
defined `init1` & `init2` in **init.hs**
