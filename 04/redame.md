# Function

## 1

using library functions, define

halve:: [a] -> ([a],[a]) 

that split s an even-lenghted list into two halves

## 2

Define a function

third :: [a] -> a

that returns the third element in a list that contains at least this many elements using:
a) head and tail
b) list indexing !!
c) pattern matching


## 3

Consider a fuction 

safetail :: [a] -> [a] 

that behaves in the same way as tail expect taht it maps the empty list to itself rather than production an error.
Unis tail ant the function null ::[a] -> Bool that decides if a list empty or not, define safetail using:
a) a condition expression
b) guard equation
c) pattern matching
